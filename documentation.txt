Angular v9 

I have used Angular Material to display data in a table. The columns are sortable.

In "HomeComponent" the "setTimeout()" function was used just to simulate an API call
which will maybe take some time to return data and in the meantime a loader is displayed.

Data is loaded from "data.json" file which is in "assets" folder.

Unit test for components and service are written in "*.specs.ts" files.
